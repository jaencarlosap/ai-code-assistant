Review the following code changes and ensure they follow best practices.  

Ignore These Kind Of Changes:
- Any dependencies updates.
- Dependency updates of files like (e.g., `package.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`).  
- Configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `.prettierrc`).  
- Anything related to package management.  

Focus Only On:  
- Focus only on code logic, best practices, security issues, and import order.  
- Presence of `console.log` statements.  
- Security vulnerabilities.  
- Unused variables.  
- Code efficiency improvements.  
- Import order, which should follow this structure:  
  1. External dependencies  
  2. Internal dependencies  
  3. Project styles  
  4. Type definitions  

If none of the above issues exist, return nothing.
